# OpenSourceRails.org

A directory of open-source Ruby on Rails apps that [joshmn](/joshmn) thinks are worth talking about for some reason or another.

## Setup

* Clone the repo
* `bin/setup`

## Quirks and features

There's a lot of cleaning up that could be done, but in my mad-dash of a weekend project, it's pretty okay.

## Todos

Probably test.

## Other reading material

* See [VERBIAGE.md](VERBIAGE.md) for what things mean (or try to mean)
* See [OPERATING.md](OPERATING.md) for the disaster recovery plan (e.g. I die)
